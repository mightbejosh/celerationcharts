The charts generated  in this software package are intended to reflect the
critical attributes of the standard charts first developed by Dr. Ogden R. Lindsley.
The number of log-based cycles on the y-axis,
amount and distribution of calendar time intervals on the x-axis, number of celeration periods,
and aspect ratio are designed to be consistent with the attributes described by Dr. Lindsley.
This log chart is a likeness of the Standard Celeration Chart Â© Behavior Research Company
